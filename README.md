# My first node web app
A practice application for grad qa's to play about with.

This version contains
- Basic html templates and partials
- Basic css
- One simple page at the website root

This version is intended to act as the most basic template to start a web application from. You're free to add whatever
you want! Just remember to clone it to your own repo, don't try to push commits back directly to this repository.

Step 1: Clone this repo (Setup your ssh for git if you've not already)

git clone git@github.com:gbutch/my-first-web-app-v1.git

Step 2: Rename the folder to whatever you want

Step 3: delete the .git file

Step 4: Initialize a new git repository

git init

Step 5: Create a new repository in git and add it as the remote

git remote add origin git@github.com:{username}/{name of repository}.git

Step 5: Make an initial commit

git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin master
